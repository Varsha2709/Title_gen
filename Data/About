YouTube, the popular video-sharing platform, keeps a list of the top trending videos on its site. These videos are not just the most-watched but are chosen based on various factors, like the number of views, shares, comments, and likes. This ensures that the list highlights videos with the most interaction, not just high view counts.

Trending videos often include music videos (like the viral hit "Gangnam Style"), celebrity or reality TV performances, and the fun, quirky videos from everyday creators that YouTube is famous for.

This dataset provides a daily record of YouTube's top trending videos. It is an improved and more structured version of a similar dataset.
